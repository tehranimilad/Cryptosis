### Technologies used: 
**MERN Stack Application**
* MongoDB 
* Express(.js)
* React
* Node

### Installation Instructions:
* Fork and Clone Repository
* In your terminal, run the following command. (On the Frontend & Backend)
```
npm i
```
### Approach Taken: 

The first step in building a MERN stack application based on cryptocurrency is to set up the MongoDB database and define the schema for storing information about the various cryptocurrencies, user information for authentication (Login & Signup), and comments that can be left by users once logged in. 

The next step is setting up the Express server and defining the API routes for interacting with the database, as well routes for updating and creating information. This includes information about other cryptocurrencies, and comments left by other users on the home/forum page. 

Once the back-end is set up, my focus shifted towards the front-end and building the user interface with React. This process included creating components that display various crptocurrency prices, as well as forms for updating and deleting data.

Finally, I used Node.js to handle the server-side logic, such as connectiong the front-end and back-end together. Node.js also handles any other server-side tasks. 

It is important to remember that I took the proper consideration when building out this application since there are security, compliance,  and regulations related to cryptocurrency. This application adheres to laws and guidelines that are related t othe handling of cryptocurrency.
